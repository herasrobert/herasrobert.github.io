Clarify Objective Placement Rules: It's not entirely clear from the rules whether objective tiles can be placed within two tiles of a terrain tile, or if they can only be placed within two tiles of a board edge. It might be helpful to clarify this point.

Add Deployment Zones: Consider adding designated deployment zones for each player. This would ensure that players have an equal opportunity to place their units and objectives, and it would also add an additional strategic layer to the game.

Add More Detail to Movement Rules: It might be helpful to provide more detail on what types of terrain are impassable, and how movement through difficult terrain works. You could also consider adding rules for charging, running, and other types of movement.

Add More Detail to Ranged Combat Rules: The rules for ranged combat seem a bit vague, particularly when it comes to line of sight and cover. It might be helpful to provide more detail on these mechanics to avoid confusion during gameplay.

Consider Adding Morale Rules: It's not entirely clear from the rules how units react to taking casualties, other than taking a courage test if they lose more than 3 HP in a turn. Consider adding more robust morale rules, such as units taking penalties to hit or run away if they take too many casualties.

Consider Adding Army List Building Rules: To give players more control over their armies, you could consider adding rules for army list building. This would allow players to choose which units they want to bring to the game, and would also allow you to balance the game more effectively.

Terrain: Consider adding different types of terrain to your battlefield, such as forests, hills, rivers, and lakes. Each type of terrain can have a different effect on movement, line of sight, and combat.

Weather: Introduce weather effects into your game, such as rain, fog, snow, or strong winds. Weather can also impact visibility and movement, and affect ranged weapons differently than melee weapons.

Random Events: Introduce random events that can affect the game, such as sudden reinforcements arriving, supply drops, or the appearance of a neutral faction that can be befriended or fought.

Resource Management: Introduce a resource management element to the game, where players have to manage and allocate resources such as food, ammunition, and fuel. This can add another layer of strategy to the game.

Unique Objectives: Create unique objectives for each side to accomplish, rather than just killing each other. These could be things like capturing a specific location, rescuing a hostage, or retrieving a valuable item.

Fog of War: Consider introducing a fog of war element to the game, where players can only see what is directly in front of them and must scout to gather information about the enemy's position and movements.

Multiplayer: If possible, make your game multiplayer so that players can compete against each other. This will add another level of challenge to the game and make it more engaging.
