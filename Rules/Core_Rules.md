# General Rules

## Preperation and Setup
- Players agree on a maximum number of points to play and will select units from their faction up to the agreed amount of points with each unit costing the points shown on the unit profile.- 
- Each player should have three objective tiles in hand and an equal number of terrain tiles.
- - Scale and shape of the map is determined by the players placing the tiles.
- Each player then takes turns placing a tile.
- Objective tiles cannot be placed within two tiles of the board edge or within five tiles of another objective.
- Each player then selects a table edge to count as their edge, usually on opposite sides
- Players then alternate placing units on the board until all units are placed.

# Playing the Game

## Standard Play
- The game is split into a number of rounds agreed upon by the players.
- During the first round Player 1 will control each of their units one time and take a move and/or action; in either order.
- Once Player 1 finishes controlling all their units, Player 2 will control their units.
- Once Player 2 finishes controlling their units, the round is considered over and the next round starts.

## Movement and Action
- Each unit can elect to move and/or take an action in either order; actions are listed on the unit profile.
- - A unit can also elect not to move or not to take an action, unless otherwise stated in the unit profile that they must move or take an action.
- Each unit can move a number of tiles equal to its movement speed but a unit cannot move onto or through a non-existant tile.
- Some tiles are impassible and will be denoted on the tile.
- A unit can choose not to move and stay within its tile unless the units profile says otherwise.

### Casting, Magic, and Ranged Attacks
Such available actions are to make a ranged attack or cast a spell.

In order to make a range attack, ensure that the defending unit is within range of the attacking unit; range is listed within the attacks profile and is a measurement of hexes.

The Attacker then draws a straight line from the closest corner of the tile of the Attacking unit to the closest corner of the tile of the defending unit. The direction of model is facing does not matter.

The Attacking unit must use all their available attacks against the defending unit and cannot split their attacks against other enemy units.

The number of dice to use will be listed on the spell action within the unit profile under 'Attack' 

In order to “Hit” your target, you roll a number of d6 equal to the Attack value of the weapon and those that land at or above the attackers "Accurancy” value are considered hits.

### Injuring - Removed

### Defense Rolls
Once an attack is considered a hit, the defending unit may usually attempt to use their defense to ignore the injury; denoting their natural toughness or magical protections against attacks.

Each unit has a Defense value within its profile and rolling at or above the defense value succeeds in defending against a hit.

Attacks have a Power value which denotes a modifier to the Defense roll, usually a negative.

A Spell with Power -2 would mean the value of the die for a Defense roll if modifiers by -2. Player 2 rolling a 2 on the die would mean the Defense Roll result is actually a 4.

Example: The Mage Unit cast Fireball and has 2 hits. Of those two hits, both d6 were 2's so there are two injuries for the defending unit to save against. Player B then takes the two die and rolls a Defense Roll per injury. The Defending unit has a Defense of 2+, which means normally Player B would be able to succeed on a two or above to ignore the injury. However, Fireball has a +2 Power, which means Player B must roll at or above a 4 for each injury to save against it. 

### Using Cover

The defending unit may choose to take a Cover Roll instead of a Defense Roll; sometimes the Cover Roll is better.

Each terrain tile has a Cover Bonus attribute. Draw a straight from the closest corner of the tile of Attacking unit to the closest corner of the tile of the defending unit.

Cover is calculated by adding the highest cover bonus of any tile in the line to your die roll.

In order to succeed on a Cover Roll, your roll with any modifiers must be above a 6.

You always take the highest cover value whether that be from terrain, Actions, Special Rules, or Upgrade.

Cover is not impacted by the Power of the attacking units weapon.


### Losing Health
Any d6 from a hit roll that is not Defended or saved by Cover counts as a one point loss against the units health.

Subtract the number of dice from the units Health pool, keep track using paper, counters, or dice themselves.

Losing health will usually affect the units Actions such as shooting.

### Melee
Melee is similar to Casting and will be an under the Action box for units that can perform melee attacks.

The defending unit must be within your Melee range for you to take the Melee action.

When you take the Melee Action, move the attacking unit so it is in an adjacent tile to the defending unit.

In Melee you have a number of attacks as listed in the Melee Action of your unit profile.

Similar to Ranged Attacks, roll the number of attacks and successful hits are the die that land at or above the Accuracy value.

The hits must then be rolled to determine if they are injuries.

The defending unit must succeed on a Defense Roll for each successful “injury” die or lose health.

You do not benefit from cover while in melee combat unless otherwise stated in the defending unit’s profile.

### Courage
A courage test must be taken at the end of a players turn if a unit lost more than 3 HP this turn.

The Player who commands the unit must roll 2d6; rolling below the units Courage counts as a success and the unit maintains its courage.

If the result is a failure, the unit has lost its courage and the unit suffers an extra 1d6 HP.

### Reinforcements
Players are allowed to keep up to half their army in points cost as reinforcements. These units are not deployed during preparation and setup.

A player may deploy reinforcements any turn after the first but must deploy all reinforcements by the start of the third game turn.

Reinforcements start on any tile within the players table edge, but some units have special rules regarding how they can be deployed as reinforcements.

Reinforcements not deployed are counted as destroyed.

## Terrain

### Types
There are many types of terrain within the game. 

Most terrain will provide some sort of cover, as denoted by the Cover value on the tile.

Some terrain counts as impassible and will be denoted on the tile; meaning you cannot place a unit or traverse the tile unless otherwise stated in the units profile.

(Pending) Some terrain adds an elevation to units that are on the tile. This adds a modifier to the accuracy of the attacking unit if the defending unit is at a lower elevation. Feedback to resolve: “Using Cover” mentioned drawing straight lines from tile to tile. How does that work with elevation? Can you shoot over things? What if a unit is on elevation and the tile to tile touches cover?  The “Using Cover” rules seems to work on a 2D context.

Tile Types: Grassland, Hills, Forest, Mountain, Ruins, Bushes, Bog, Miasma, Impassible, Lake

### Capturing Objectives
Any unit within one adjacent tile of an objective is considered to be contesting the objective.

The player with the most units contesting an objective count as capturing the objective and earns two points at the end of each round.
