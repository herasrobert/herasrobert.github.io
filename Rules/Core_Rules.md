# General Rules

## Preperation and Setup
- Each player should have three objective tiles in hand and an equal number of terrain tiles.
- Each player then takes turns placing a tile.
- Objective tiles cannot be placed within two tiles of the board edge or within five tiles of another objective.
- Each player then selects a table edge to count as their edge, usually on opposite sides
- Players then alternate placing units on the board until all units are placed.

# Playing the Game

## Standard Play
- The game is split into five rounds.
- During the first round Player 1 will control each of their units and take a move and/or action.
- Once Player 1 finishes controlling all their units, Player 2 will control their units.
- Once Player 2 finishes controlling their units, the round is considered over and the next round starts.

## Movement
- Each unit can move a number of tiles equal to its movement speed unless a tile says it’s impassible terrain.
- A unit can choose not to move and stay within its tile unless the units profile says otherwise.

## Action
- Each unit that moves must take an action immediately after moving.
- Possible actions are listed on the units profile.

### Casting, Magic, and Ranged Attacks
Such available actions are to make a ranged attack or cast a spell.

In order to make a range attack, ensure that the defending unit is within range of the attacking unit; range is listed within the attacks profile.

The Attacker then draws a straight line from the closest corner of the tile of Attacking unit to the closest corner of the tile of the defending unit.

The number of dice to use will be listed on the spell action within the unit profile under 'Attack' 

In order to “Hit” your target, you roll a number of d6 equal to the Attack value and those that land at or above the attackers "Accurancy” value are considered hits.

Example: Player 1 is using a Mage Unit to cast a Fireball. The Mage Units Accuracy is 3+ and the Fireball spell is 4 Attacks. This means Player 1 would roll 4d6 and any that land at or above a three are considered to have hit the defending unit.

### Injuring
Each "Hit" roll is followed by injury rolls to determine how many of those hits actually injure the unit.

For every die that counts as a hit, roll it and if you land at or above the spells "Power" value it counts as an injury to the defending unit.

Example: The Mage Unit in the above example rolled 4d6 to hit. Assuming two of those four attack die landed above a three, Player 1 would then roll the two successes again to determine injury towards the defending unit. Fireball has a Power value of 2+. This means that if any of the two die rolled are a two or above, then the defending unit counts as risking two injuries.

### Defense Rolls
Once an attack is considered to risk injury, the defending unit may usually attempt to use their defense to ignore the injury; denoting their natural toughness or magical protections against attacks.

When applicable, a Defense Roll is taken against any injury to ignore it.

Each unit has a Defense value within its profile and rolling at or above the defense value succeeds in defending against the roll.

Some Spells and Attacks have a Penetration value, this denotes a change in the difficulty of the Defense roll.

A Spell with Penetration +2 would mean the Defense roll must be at or above the Defense + Penetration (2) value.

Example: The Mage Unit cast Fireball and has 2 hits. Of those two hits, both d6 were 2's so there are two injuries for the defending unit to save against. Player B then takes the two die and rolls a Defense Roll per injury. The Defending unit has a Defense of 2+, which means normally Player B would be able to succeed on a two or above to ignore the injury. However, Fireball has a +2 Penetration, which means Player B must roll at or above a 4 for each injury to save against it. 

### Using Cover

The defending unit may choose to take a Cover Roll instead of a Protection Roll; sometimes the Cover Roll is better.

Any unit can take a cover save of 6+ unless otherwise stated in the unit profile.

Each terrain tile has a Cover Bonus attribute. Draw a straight from the closest corner of the tile of Attacking unit to the closest corner of the tile of the defending unit.

Cover is calculated by subtracting the highest cover bonus of any tile in the line from 6. The player must then roll above that value.

Note: you always take the highest cover value whether that be from terrain, Actions, Special Rules, or Upgrade.

Example: Player 1 used their Mage Squad to cast Fireball and because of Fireballs +2 Penetration, the Defending unit unit must suceed on a 4+ to defend against the Fireball attack. However, between the Mage Squad and the Defending unit is a Forest Terrain Tile that grants a +3 Cover Bonus. This means the defending unit can elect to take a Cover Roll intead of a Defense Roll. The Cover Roll result to be beat is 6 - 3 = 3+.

### Losing Health
Any d6 from a “injury” roll that is not Protected or saved by Cover counts as a one point loss against the units health.

Subtract the number of dice from the units Health pool, keep track using paper, counters, or dice themselves.

Losing health will usually affect the units Actions such as shooting.

### Melee
Melee is similar to Casting and will be an under the Action box for units that can perform melee attacks.

The defending unit must be within your Melee range for you to take the Melee action.

When you take the Melee Action, move the attacking unit so it is in an adjacent tile to the defending unit.

In Melee you have a number of attacks as listed in the Melee Action of your unit profile.

Similar to Ranged Attacks, roll the number of attacks and successful hits are the die that land at or above the Accuracy value.

The hits must then be rolled to determine if they are injuries.

The defending unit must succeed on a Defense Roll for each successful “injury” die or lose health.

You do not benefit from cover while in melee combat unless otherwise stated in the defending unit’s profile.

### Courage
A courage test must be taken at the end of a players turn if a unit lost more than 3 HP this turn.

The Player who commands the unit must roll 2d6; rolling below the units Courage counts as a success and the unit maintains its courage.

If the result is a failure, the unit has lost its courage and the unit suffers an extra 1d6 HP.

### Reinforcements
Players are allowed to keep up to half their army in points cost as reinforcements. These units are not deployed during preparation and setup.

A player may deploy reinforcements any turn after the first but must deploy all reinforcements by the start of the third game turn.

Reinforcements start on any tile within the players table edge, but some units have special rules regarding how they can be deployed as reinforcements.

Reinforcements not deployed are counted as destroyed.

## Terrain

### Types
There are many types of terrain within the game. 

Most terrain will provide some sort of cover, as denoted by the Cover value on the tile.

Some terrain counts as impassible and will be denoted on the tile; meaning you cannot place a unit or traverse the tile unless otherwise stated in the units profile.

Terrain tiles with a Cover of -6 count as blocking sight; the Defending unit will have a 0 on their Cover Roll which is an automatic success.

Some terrain adds an elevation to units that are on the tile. This adds a modifier to the accuracy of teh attacking unit if the defending unit is at a lower elevation.

Tile Types: Grassland, Hills, Forest, Mountain, Ruins, Bushes, Bog, Miasma, Impassible, Lake

### Capturing Objectives
Any unit within one tile of an objective is considered to be contesting the objective.

The player with the most units contesting an objective count as capturing the objective and earns two points at the end of each round.
